# ðŸ˜Š Mood Optimization Swarm API  
**Evolving AI personalities for more natural, emotionally aware conversations**

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project simulates a swarm of AI agents with diverse conversational traits (tone, style, timing) that evolve over generations to optimize mood impact and engagement. Instead of traditional gradient-based learning, it uses instinct-driven mutations and fitness scoring inspired by swarm intelligence.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files  
- `voice_agent.py` â€” Defines agent traits, mutation logic, and fitness evaluation  
- `mood_swarm.py` â€” Runs the evolutionary simulation and visualizes results  
- `requirements.txt` â€” Lists Python dependencies  
- `swarm_demo.png` â€” Sample graph showing fitness improvements over generations

## ðŸ”§ How to Use  
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the evolutionary simulation
python mood_swarm.py
